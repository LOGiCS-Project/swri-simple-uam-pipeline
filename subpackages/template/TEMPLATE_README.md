# Subpackage template

A [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template for generating a new
subproject within this repository.

This is a highly stripped version of the [copier-pdm](https://github.com/pawamoy/copier-pdm)
project, with lots of unnecessary features removed.
Look there if you're trying to reintroduce CI, `mkdocs`, or something
else.


## Usage

  - `cd ../` (i.e. the *repo's* root directory)
  - `conda activate simple-uam`
  - `invoke new-subpackage`
  - Follow the prompts.
