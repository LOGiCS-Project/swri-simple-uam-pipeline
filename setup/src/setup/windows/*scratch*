  - sensible to inject adm , even in next model
  - adding features
  - FEM or fluid not in near future
  - intent for custom controllers
    - provided acess to state acess to state vector + current mission state
    - provide control parameter settings
    - shared library w/ ccompatible inter
    - static mission defition provided before run -> compile into controller
  - fderiv has derivative of FDM as single call
  - missions transition between phases
    - e.g. pickup, flight, dropoff, return
  - improvements to internal autopilot
  - can run step in controller? (provide full state?)
  - target in november
  - fortran not great to interface in non-c compatible format
  - direct to cad doesn't go through openMETA
    - helpful for if there's a lot of different parameters to work with.
    - also skips openMETA steps, gives graph rep of ADM files (time saving inherent
      to skip)
    - intention
  - testbench_panifest made in openMETA testbench
  - direct2cad uses graph rep and cad model.
    - stl and stp file actually passed to run fdm file.
